- An issue exists on boot where root runs the decider but doesn't detect faces properly.
     This can be resolved by sshing in as the pi user, activating the virtualenv, kill -9 existing python pid, and rerunning the decider
- Would be nice to make Polly speak if an exception is encountered and specify where it happened
- Polly cold start issues?
